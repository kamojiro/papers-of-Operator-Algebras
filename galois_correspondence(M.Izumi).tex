\section{A Galois Correspondence for compact Groups of Automorphisms of von Neumann Algebras with a Generalization to Kac Algebra (M.Izumi, R.Longo, S.Popa)}
\cite{izumi1998galois}

Nakamura and Takeda \cite{nakamura1960galois}, and Suzuki showed such(closed subgroup version) galois correspondence in the ccase of $II_1$-factor and $G$ a finite group whose action on $M$ is minimal, i.e. $M^{G'} \cap M = \C$.
Kishimoto \cite{kishimoto1977remarks} showed a galois ocrrespondence, between normal closed subgroups of a compact (minimal) group $G$ and globally $G$-invariant intermediate von Neumann algebras,
following methods in the analysis of chemical potential in Quantum Statistical Mechanics.
Generalizations of this result concerning dual actions of aloccaly compact group $G$ were dealt by Takesaki \cite{araki1977extension}, in case of $G$ abelian, and by Nakagami in more generality.

Another kind of Galis correspondence was provided by H.Choda \cite{choda1978galois}.
In concerns in particular the crossed product of a factor by an outer action of a discrete group and characterizes the intermediate von Neumann subakgebras that are crossed product by a discrete subgrups.
An important assumption here is the existence of a normal conditional expectation onto the intermediate subalgebras. 
\begin{theorem}
  Let $G$ be a discrete group and $\alpha$ ab outer action of $G$ on a factor $N$.
  Then, the map
  \begin{align*}
    H \mapsto N \rtimes_\alpha H
  \end{align*}
  gives one-to-one correspondence between the lattice of all subgroups of $G$ and that of all subgroups of $G$ and that of all intermedidate sufactors of $N \subset N \rtimes_\alpha G$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}%%[\cite{izumi1998galois}Thm 3.15]
  Let $G$ be  compact group and $\alpha$ a minimal action of $G$ on a factor $M$.
  The, the map
  \begin{align*}
    H \mapsto M^H
  \end{align*}
  gives one-to-one correspondence between the lattice of all closed subgroups of $G$ and that of all intermediate subfactors of $M \supset M^G$.
\end{theorem}
