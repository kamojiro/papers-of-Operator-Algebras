\begin{theorem}[\cite{izumi2002inclusions}, Corollary 6.6]
  Let $\alpha$ be an outer action of a finite group $G$ on a simple $\sigma$-unital C*-algebra A.
  Then,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of $G$ and the set of intermedeiate C*-algebras between $A \rtimes_\alpha G \supset A$.
    Thecorrespondence is given as follows: For a subgroup $H$, the corresponding intermediate C*-algebra is $A \rtimes_\alpha G$.
  \item There exists a one-to-one correspondence between the set of subgroups of $g$ and the set of intermediate C*-subalgebras between $A \supset A^\alpha$.
    The correspondence is given as follows:
    For a subgroup $H$,
    the corresponding intermediate C*-algebra is the fixed point subalgebra of $A$ under the restriction of $\alpha$ to $H$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
