\begin{theorem}[\cite{zacharias2001splitting}, Corollary 3.4]
  Let $A$ be a unital C*-algebra.
  Then $A$ is simple and has property (S) iff for any unital C~-algebra B and C s.t. $A \otimes 1 \subset C \subset A \otimes B$
  we have $C = A \otimes B_0$ for some subalgebra $B_0 \subset B$.
\end{theorem}
